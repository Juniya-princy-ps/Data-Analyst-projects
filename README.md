 Project Overview:
 
This project showcases a comprehensive HR dashboard built to analyze employee metrics such as attrition rates, job satisfaction, and employee demographics. The dashboard offers interactive visualizations, key performance indicators, and customizable filters, enabling users to explore financial trends and gain actionable insights. It is a powerful tool for stakeholders to monitor business performance and make data-driven decisions.

Data sources:

HR DATA: The data for this Power BI dashboard is sourced from a CSV file containing Employee data.It includes information on employee demographics, job roles, department allocation, and job satisfaction.

Tools:

- Power BI: Used for creating and designing the interactive dashboard with user-friendly visualizations.
 
 - Power Query: Utilized to clean and transform the raw data to ensure consistency and accuracy in the dashboard.
 
 - SQL: Employed to extract and manipulate data, enabling efficient analysis and creation of calculated columns for further insights.

 Data Cleaning/Preparation:
 
Data Integration: Employee records, attrition statistics, and job satisfaction data from multiple sources were combined using Power Query to create a unified dataset for analysis.

Handling Missing Values: Any missing values in the dataset were addressed using appropriate techniques, ensuring that all data points were valid for analysis.

Standardizing Data Formats: Data formats (e.g., age groups, and department names) were standardized to ensure consistency across the dataset.

Creating Calculated Measures: Various calculated columns and measures, such as attrition percentages and job satisfaction ratings, were created to facilitate better insights and visualizations.

  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
1. *Attrition Trends*: How does employee attrition vary across different departments and education fields? Are certain departments experiencing higher attrition rates than others?
2. *Employee Demographics*: What are the key demographics of the workforce (age distribution, gender ratio) and how do they affect attrition and satisfaction?
3. *Job Satisfaction*: Which roles have higher satisfaction levels? Are there any patterns in job satisfaction by age or gender?
4. *Education Field and Attrition*: How does the attrition rate differ across employees from various educational backgrounds? Do certain fields contribute more to employee turnover?

Data Analysis:

The analysis focuses on workforce trends, attrition hotspots, and job satisfaction levels:

Attrition Analysis: The dashboard highlights a total of 237 employees who have left the organization, with the majority (65.37%) from the R&D department. Other departments with significant attrition include Sales and HR.

Employee Age Group Distribution: The majority of employees fall within the 25-34 age group, with a nearly equal split between genders. The dashboard also tracks attrition rates across different age groups.

Job Satisfaction: Job satisfaction levels are displayed for roles such as Healthcare Representatives, Managers, Laboratory Technicians, and Sales Executives, providing insights into which roles may need attention from HR.

Results:


High Attrition in R&D: The R&D department exhibits the highest attrition rate, requiring further investigation to understand the underlying causes.

Young Workforce: A large portion of the workforce consists of younger employees (25-34 age group), which may indicate growth opportunities but also potential challenges related to employee retention and development.

Job Satisfaction Insights: Job satisfaction is generally higher among Research Directors and Scientists, while Sales Executives and Healthcare Representatives have comparatively lower satisfaction levels, signaling a need for HR to address concerns in these roles.

Recommendations:

Address High Attrition in R&D: Further analysis and targeted interventions should be undertaken to reduce attrition rates in the R&D department. This may include employee engagement surveys, career development programs, and workload management.

Focus on Employee Retention: Given the high proportion of younger employees, the organization should focus on implementing programs for career progression, mentorship, and skill development to retain talent.

Improve Job Satisfaction in Key Roles: HR should consider conducting further surveys and feedback sessions with Sales Executives and Healthcare Representatives to understand their concerns and improve job satisfaction levels through recognition, rewards, or workload adjustments.
